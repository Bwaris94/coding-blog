A blog for everything coding.
*Not* for content-marketing disguised as programming tutorials.
*Not* for advertisement blended with sincerely interesting pieces.
*Quality*. *Articles*. *About*. *Coding*.

# Where We Are

Today, it feels like most articles are trying to sell you something. They are,
as they cannot reach you for free. Curators like Medium need to put work into
ensuring you get these pieces, while directly and indirectly shifting the cost
to the authors. Authors, to make up for that cost, fallback on some form of content-marketing.
Promoting the company they work in, promoting a specific product, or promoting themselves,
they need some return on the time and effort they put in ensuring their writings reach you.

Today, if you want to share your experiences, you need to either give up ownership of
your content to some platform, or go through lots of work for deploying a readable, usable
blog. You need to either put your article behind the not-so-lovely Medium
paywall, or you need to put in many hours to ensure people who would enjoy your work
hear about it. Today, if you try to just share your experiences with your fellow programmers, in an unbiased,
impartial manner, you most probably will not get back what you put in.

# Where We Want to Go

With `coding.blog`, we want to change that. We want to help authors write elegant, modern coding blogs,
retaining ownership of their work, while avoiding the hassles of setting up their own blog system,
and benefiting from being part of a curated platform.

We want to enable authors rely on the support of their community to keep on the great work, instead
of being forced to put their pieces behind paywalls. As with the spirit of open-source, coding knowledge and 
experience should be shared freely for anyone who might be able to use it to create something better 
for the rest of the community, while the authors receive the appreciation and support they deserve for it.
Thats when we thrive as a community.

Curation is never free for the readers. Google charges the companies who advertise on it, and they charge
that cost from you when you buy from them. Medium forces authors to put their work behind paywalls, 
or indirectly charges them for cost of delivering their work to you.

We want to deliver to readers content that is pure from any marketing scheme or dishonest intentions,
in exchange for transparent and honest pricing. We do not want to make it a moral decision of how much
to dress up an ad like content you might actually like. You should not have to trust our morals. Our
process should speak it for itself, it should get you the best content for you.
