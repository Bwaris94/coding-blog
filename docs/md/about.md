# About

While `coding.blog` is a mostly open-source project, it is maintained
by [CONNECT-platform](https://connect-platform.com) team. Our goal in CONNECT-platform
is to create tools for making lives easier for software developers. We believe
that goal can only be achieved via an open and collaborative community, hence all
of our products are open-source or mostly open-sourced (some parts aren't due
to security reasons), which is also how we plan to move forward with `coding.blog`.
