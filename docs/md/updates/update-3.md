# Update #3 -  September 2020

Since our [previous update](/updates/update-2), we have progressed with our alpha program with opening up more blogs
from our prospective creator's list. We've made small updates and improvements to our publishing toolchain, and have
worked on some restructuring of the publish pipeline and our CDNs to make it more cost-effective, though these restructurings
are still being worked on. We have also published the [second public issue](/public-issues/issue-2), and have
started working on some new ideas and features for the platform, which I will elaborate upon in detail.

## Public Issue #2

We have published [Public Issue #2](/public-issues/issue-2). As mentioned before, our main monetisation plan
is through personalized monthly issues, and public issues serve as publicly available, free and non-personalized
version of those. Beyond this, we are observing that there are more generic topics that might not be suitable
for personalized private issues (as they might not be targeting an individual reader's specific interests directly),
and we suspect that kind of content will find its long-term home in our public issues.

With public issue #2 though, we also included pieces talking about online harassments programmers might face,
ethical dilemmas of our line of work that we might inadvarently overlook, and the broader issue of diversity in IT.
We believe solely sharing technical experiences in isolation and without the context of personal perspective of
people accumulating those technical experiences will not be as worthwile, as there is much to learn from a case of
someone being harassed on some open-source PR or someone being marginalized in a tech lead job opportunity as there is
from exploring new frameworks and tools, and all these experiences together will help us grow, as individuals and
as a community.

## Curation of External Blogs / Articles

Within our public issues, we have incorporated interesting articles that were not published on `coding.blog` blogs.
Since we have received questions on whether we plan to do the same for private issues and what is our long term policy
towards inclusion of external blogs and articles in our curation system, I think this is a good opportunity to elaborate
on what we envision on that front.

Our aim with the `coding.blog` publishing platform is to provide a free, convenient and optimized-for-programming-content
toolchain allowing authors to publish their work and share their experiences while retaining full ownership of their content.

With our curation, both public and private issues, we aim to spread the word about nice articles which we think will
be impactful on individual readers on their own, regardless of whether they are published using our publishing tools or not.
We believe that these curation services will be valuable enough to sustain this whole venture financially, but more importantly
we believe this will reduce the costs of promotion from authors, allowing for more pieces solely focusing on sharing experience
to be published, as where we currently stand, the costs are high enough to eventually drive a lot of produced content to be
some form of content-marketing (as it would need to make up for said costs).

That said, the impact of any article we _curate_ (or _promote_), for any individual reader,
can be approximated by the product of the probability of said reader not knowing about said article,
and the impact reading said article for the first time would have on the said reader.

> :Formula
>
> I_{\text{telling} ~ R ~ \text{about}~ A} = P_{R ~ {\text{not knowing about}} ~ A} * I_{R ~ \text{reading} ~ A}

This means the value of our curation would be typically much higher for articles that people aren't likely
to have heared about otherwise. At least at current stage, this means that through our curation we can add most value
by promoting articles on `coding.blog`, since articles from external sources typically have been circulated
to some degree when we hear about them and can add them to our curation list.

To mitigate that effect, we are contemplating on ways we could integrate external personal blogs, so that an author
who has already setup their own nice publishing toolchain (and perhaps on their own domain) but could benefit from
our curation services would also be able to. When the process is established, we will post about it so that we can
start integrating such external blogs into our curation system as well.

## Code Casts

Another area we are working on are **Code Casts**. If you are unfamiliar with the concept, it is basically like a video
of a code-snippet being written, but you can pause and inspect (and ideally copy or link) the code at any timestamp.
These kind of snippets typically accompany some audio track of the coder explaining what is happening, alongside maybe some
other video tracks (or similar data) displaying the _output_ of the code (to some degree).

The reason we feel **Code Casts** are important is that we observe a lot of nice programming articles sharing the same
structure, a code snippet that evolves across the article with text explaining such evolutions and occasional video / screenshots
showing some for of _output_ of said code.

The challenge here, is to capture the process properly (i.e. with the cursor and allowing highlighting and marking specific
parts while _casting_), while maintaining scalability and readability of the format across different devices (for example
on mobile phones), and while keeping the format open so that people are not dependent on a particular cloud service
for storage / serving of their casts, and while keeping the format as lightweight as possible to ensure high readability
in various situations.

All of these constraints means that we will most probably be rolling out **Code Casts** in multiple phases. For example, we
might initially only roll out evolving code snippets with an attached audio track and roll out the _output_ feature a bit later,
etc.

In either case, we have started internal iteration on the concept, and will keep you informed on its progress in our future updates.
For now, we can provide a sneak-peek into how our latest iteration looks like:

## Future Updates

We will keep you updated as we progress forward on this path. `coding.blog` is heavily
reliant on the community to work-out, so we think extreme transparency in whatever we are doing
is essential in its success.

You can [follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/coding_blog) for more frequent updates and a regular does
of new articles published on the platform, or stay tuned for the next update!
