# Update #1 -  June 2020

About a month ago, we first announced `coding.blog`. It was received really
well by the community, much more enthusiastically than what we had anticipated.
So since then, we've been at work to more sharply outline our roadmap and work
towards making coding.blog a reality. 

Here is a rundown of what has happened since our announcement and our future plans:

- The [first blog](https://eugene.coding.blog) was released alongside a
[plugin for **CODEDOC**](https://connect-platform.github.io/coding-blog-plugin) 
that helps developers create more elegant blogs about coding both on `coding.blog` and on other hosting
services (or for self-hosted blogs).

- We've started the **alpha stage**: we are slowly activating blogs of writers who signed up on our prospective
creators list (you can still sign-up: https://coding.blog/creators). The first batch of creators already have their blogging space set up and have begun testing and publishing their blogs.

- As the created content begins to grow, we will start featuring the top blogs (based on relevance and quality of content, topic and writing) on `coding.blog` itself. We will also support the creators by promoting their content organically as well.  

- Along with that process, we will further develop and finalize the curation pipeleine and enter the **beta stage**, where people will receive personalized curated lists.

- In lock-step with the above processes, we will begin rolling out the tipping system as well.

- We have conducted a more in-depth financial analysis of this project, and are exploring different financing options for the initial stage of this project.

## First Blog and Blogging Tools

We released the first version of the publishing process. It works by binding
a publicly accessible blog repository with a domain name, which is done [via blog management interface](/account/blog).
Alongside it, we published the [first blog](https://eugene.coding.blog).

While working on the first blog, we realized that although **CODEDOC** is capable of producing
elegant programming blogs, we often find ourselves building custom components specifically for
blogging purposes (for example hero images, author information, etc.). As a result, we standardized
and released a _plugin system_ for **CODEDOC**, and created 
[a plugin](https://connect-platform.github.io/coding-blog-plugin) that provides these components
and tools.

This plugin is not limited to `coding.blog` blogs. You can utilize it on blogs using **CODEDOC**,
hosted anywhere (including GitHub Pages). To make the process even more convenient, we created
[this starter project](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/coding-blog-boilerplate), which
has **CODEDOC** setup and the plugin pre-installed on it, and is enriched with proper config and workflows
for deployment to `coding.blog` and automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Alpha Stage

We began activating blogs of prospective creators. This process happens in batches: In each batch,
a number of prospective creators will have their accounts created and their preferred domains (`their.coding.blog`)
bound to their account, receiving an email with a link to access and manage their account and their
blog.

We opted for a slow roll-out instead of an all-out access to ensure that we will have the capacity
to focus on feedback of every creator. Our publishing process might need further polish, our Content Delivery Network (CDN) might
require further optimization, or there simply might be great ideas from authors and creators on making `coding.blog` a better blogging tool, and we don't want to miss any of that!

The first batch of creator accounts were activated today. We simply prioritize people who are
more likely to start creating content and test our systems more actively, also emphasizing the
diversity of specific fields they might focus on (frontend, backend, devops, ML, data science, theoretical CS, etc.).

If you are enlisted as a prospective creator and are eager to help us conduct testing, simply
drop me an email on [eugene@connect-platform.com](mailto:eugene@connect-platform.com). If you
are not enlisted as a prospective creator and want to be, [you can do so here](/creator).

## Towards Beta Stage

We anticipate more content to be generated on `coding.blog` as more creators are on-boarded.
As this number grows, we will begin featuring top posts on `coding.blog` itself and promoting
them via other channels.

When we reach a sufficient number of blog posts with a sufficient flow of new articles, we
will begin finalizing the curation system and pipeline. When this is finished, we will
be able to begin the **beta stage**, where beta users will receive their accounts and curated
article lists based on their preferences.

We also plan to roll-out the tipping system around this time. Proper roll-out and testing
of the tipping system is also dependent on the amount and flow of articles we have and
community interaction, and might happen before or after the start of the **beta stage**.

## Financial Stability

We are managing `coding.blog` in an exceedingly _lean_ manner financially, meaning we
try to minimize all costs and only scale them in lock-step with the traction. The decentralized
nature of the platform, alongside the fact that all the underlying tools (such as **CODEDOC**
or `coding-blog-plugin`) are open-source, help a lot (so if you want to help out, the best
way right now would be contributing to these open-source projects).

However, based on our financial assessment, we would require some external investment/funding
before reaching the break-even point. The exact amount is highly dependendt on the
growth rate of `coding.blog`, and we do not intend to slow its growth down due to financial reasons,
specifically considering the amount of enthusiasm and support from the community we have received.

As a result, we have begun exploring the idea of external investment/funding for this project. This is only
to be able to manage the initial growth phase (if the traction remains sustainable), as we intend to avoid allowing this project
becoming another heavily-investment dependent and unnaturally hyped tech project that remains
at a loss years into its existence.

## Future Updates

We will keep you updated as we progress forward on this path. `coding.blog` is heavily
reliant on the community to work-out, so we think extreme transparency in whatever we are doing
is essential in its success. So stay tuned as we'll be back soon with more news!
