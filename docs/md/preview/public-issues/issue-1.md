# Public Issue #1

## Foreword

About two months ago, we started working on [`coding.blog`](https://coding.blog) with the vision of creating
a proper home for quality blogs about programming. No ads, no content-marketing, just pure programming passion, 
knowledge and experience sharing.

To that end, we envisioned a solution composed of two components: An open-source, convenient, and elegant-out-of-the-box
solution for writing about programming, and a quality and fair curation mechanism ensuring that people
will hear about content they are interested in. Imagine a high quality programming journal that is tailored specifically
to your interest! That is where we want to head, and that is what we believe can sustain such a platform and keep
it free from ads or paywalls.

These public issues are to serve as glimpses of that vision. They are collections of recent articles we found
interesting. More than half, but not all, are created with our own authoring tools, by passionate members of our
community. However, they are not exclusive to `coding.blog`s, as if a piece is free to access and interesting,
then we want to help spread the word.

> title=Why Medium Doesn't Work for Programmers
>
> Since its foundation, Medium has been a popular home for programming blogs. However, the promise
> of it getting better for programming content never materialized, and the popularity has started
> to dwindle due to promotion being tied to its paywall.

> This blog post is being created using CODEDOC. And more specifically, it's being created in response to the activation of my hosted blog, eon.coding.blog. I've never used CODEDOC before and coding.blog is in an alpha stage at the moment, so I thought it would be interesting to give some first impressions on using them both.

While this wasn’t too hard to achieve, I had to incorporate a lot of stuff I have only learned about then, as I’m still relatively new to building iOS apps. The existing guides were either still for mainly UIKit based apps or only covered the basics.

> As of this writing, I've been working on the RxJS project for almost 6 years, I think. When I started out, I really had no idea what I was getting into (And I wouldn't have been able to ship those first versions without Paul Taylor and others, for sure). I can remember looking at the number of weekly downloads on npm, and being able to figure out how exactly how many of them were mine. Fast forward to today, RxJS and observables have become extremely popular... Loved by many, hated by a few, and my fear is, misunderstood by most.

> > So-called "Lazy" evaluated functions have their actual execution delayed until a "terminator" function is called. It's common for lazy functions to be chained together using fluent interfaces, culminating with actions being performed when the terminator function is called. What can Salesforce developers writing Apex code stand to gain by learning more about lazy functions?

> The identity function is so trivial. And yet, it is important enough that both F# and Haskell expose this function to all developers under the name id. The standard justification is that id can be a useful argument to a higher-order function. This is certainly true, but it is not the only justification. In C#, I have found reasonable uses for calling id as an extension method.

## Few Last Words

As said before, these issues are glimpses of what we want our curated issues to be: quality collections of
recent programming articles, tailored to your interests. If you are interested, you can 
[follow us on twitter for more updates](https://twitter.com/coding_blog), or join our beta waiting list:

<br>

Also we should thank all of the authors featured on this issue, for sharing their experiences. The world of coding is built
upon sharing knowledge and experience, and writing about your experiences is a crucial element of that. 

This also cannot be achieved without the help of the community. If you want to help us further this vision of an open
and ad-free home for quality coding blogs, you can do so by spreading the word, or even better yet, join
our community of creators.
