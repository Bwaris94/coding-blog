# Public Issue #2

## Foreword

In the age of copious information, amidst a pandemic, rampant conspiracy theories and social unrest, it has become increasingly difficult to separate fact from fiction. Within this context, it becomes necessary for us to reflect on our own values, what we envision for our content and how we, in our own small way, aim to help with providing an ecosystem of reliable and trustworthy content. 

One of our core aims is to always have content that is freely available for everyone to access and not hidden behind paywalls. This is one of our main criteria in qualifying and adding pieces to our Public and Private Issues since we strongly believe that knowledge needs to be freely shared. This is also one of the main reasons why our platform will always be free for writers and for people to read the articles. 

Since we aim to monetise directly through curation, our first step is to acknowledge that curation is a value laden process. We believe talking solely about programming related concepts in isolation is redundant. Talking about these concepts while contextualising them within the socio-economic environments that they originate and exist in, and through the lens of the experience of programmers is where we truly learn. So while we strive to stay clear of articles that are opinions disguised as factual dissemination, we also actively highlight pieces showcasing 
experiences of programmers, from stories of harassments experienced by historically marginalised groups, ethical dilemmas faced by programmers,
to technologies that propel initiatives aimed at equality of opportunity.

In short, we strive for our curation services (manifested as public and future private issues) to be reflective of these values. As it is
through sharing and learning from these experiences that we can grow as a community.

> title=On all that fuckery
>
> From July 14 to August 17, 2020 (at time of publish), I experienced targeted harassment on GitHub—the company I'm employed at—via coordination happening on several "technology" 4chan threads about me. I wanted to share this story publicly to reiterate the bullshit marginalized folks in tech have to go through in order to be successful, visible, and just exist.

> Congratulations! Let’s take a moment to celebrate the decision you’ve made to launch or redirect your career. What lies ahead is a lot of hard work, satisfaction, the occasional desire to throw your laptop out a window, and a ton of learning. That’s true of most professions, so you’re also in good company.

But have you still felt frustrated by your team's speed of execution? Have you asked yourself, perhaps in the middle of a Sprint planning session, are we stuck?

This is reflected in my blog posts, which often talk about projects that may seem pointless, ill-advised or Byzantine. But I hope you'll find them as entertaining and educational as I did.

> AWS's SNS is very versatile and generally a good starting point for you when you need to send push notifications to your users. One thing that has bugged me, though, was the lack of good guidance to quickly get something running. That's why I'm writing this posts, so you don't have to deal with clicking through more than two pages of Google search results.

As such, there are many available libraries for implementing game functionality. The APIs come in many flavors. I have tried many over the last couple years, but Piston, which was one of the first I came across, remains my favorite.

We’ll compare Nginx to Envoy across many software engineering and operational dimensions. We’ll also briefly touch on the migration process, its current state, and some of the problems encountered on the way.
