## Goals

**For Readers**:
- Full, free access to all articles
- No ad-disguised-as-an-article
- Ad-free, quality curation

**For Authors**:
- Full ownership of their work
- Easy-to-work-with toolchain for producing modern and elegant articles
- Extreme customization
- Support by the community
- No concern for spreading the word

## How Will it Work

Each blogspace on [`coding.blog`](https://coding.blog) will be a git repo owned by its author, including some markdown files
and some configuration indicating how those markdown files should be presented. Each repo will be bound to some domain aka `jacks.coding.blog`, and for each publish, [`coding.blog`](https://coding.blog) will pull the repo, build the content into
a JAMStack app, distribute it on its CDNs, and queue the new content for curation.

Readers can get personalized curation lists for a monthly fee if they chose to, the revenue of which will be used to pay the costs of curation and payback the authors whose work people are paying to stay informed about. The JAMStack app will also be equipped with a tipping feature that allows the community to directly support an author for an article.

> Note that these are our current plans and they might change as we figure out what will
> work best towards our outlined goals.
